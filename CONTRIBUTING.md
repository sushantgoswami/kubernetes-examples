# Contributing To Kubernetes Examples

Firstly, big thanks for considering contributing to the project. We really hope to make this into a
community project and to do that we need your help!

## Code of Conduct

We are serious about making this a welcoming, happy project. We will not tolerate discrimination,
aggressive or insulting behaviour.

To this end, the project and everyone participating in it is bound by the [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behaviour to any of the project admins or ian.miell@container-solutions.com.

## Bugs/Mistakes

If there is mistake in one of the YAML files, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/kuberntes-examples/issues). If the YAML doesn't work on
a given platform, please provide details of the platform. If it's a simple fix e.g. the API version
needs updated, please consider opening a PR instead. 

## Contributing New Examples

New examples are warmly welcomed! But please make sure they are in-keeping with the style of the
existing examples. All examples should be:

    - As simple as possible to illustrate the functionality

    - Self-contained (ie limited to one .yaml file)

    - Non-conflicting (eg resource names are unique)

    - Clear (eg resource names are verbose and unambiguous)
 
Please open a Pull Request to contribute new examples.

## Pull Request Process

All PRs have to be reviewed and signed off by another developer before being merged to the master
branch. This review may ask for some changes - please don't be alarmed or upset at this; it is
expected that all PRs will need tweaks and a normal part of the process.
